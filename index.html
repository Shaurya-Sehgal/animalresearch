            The Woodland Caribou are animals that are currently threatened with
            only 3000 of them left. They are brown in colour and vary from 1-1.2
            meters in height. The average weight for males is 180 kg and for
            females 135 kg. They can only be found in Yukon, Northwest
            Territories, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
            Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador and live in Canada's
            boreal forests. They require large contiguous areas of suitable
            habitat with low levels of disturbances which is why they live
            there. Their life span is around 15 years.

            So, you may be asking why are the woodland caribou threatened and
            how can we help? The woodland waribou are at risk due to human
            disturbance, construction of roads and pipelines, hunting, and
            habitat destruction. Forestry, agricultural spread, and mining have
            also degraded and fragmented the caribou's habitat. It also faces a
            few different challanges like a lack of food availability during
            extreme cold and ice and depression due to inbreeding. Whats being
            done? The Woodland Caribou is federally protected under the Species
            At Risk Act and under the Canada National Parks Act (where it is
            found in Canadian National Parks). It's also provincially protected
            in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories,
            and Alberta.
